Here's a short guide on how to get yourself established with this template:

1) Pick a name for your project
    - Rename "python_package_name" folder to that name
    - setup.py => Set the "name" value
    - tox.ini => Replace "python_package_name" with that name

2) Determine what verion of Python you are looking to develop on
    - We recommend 3.7.6 at this point

3) Once you determine your Python version, you'll need to update your version choice in a few places:
    - mypy.ini => Set the "python_version" value
    - tox.ini => Set the "basepython" value
    - setup.py => Remove the invalid Python version(s) from the list if your code won't be compatible with them

4) Setup a Python virtual environment using PyCharm
    - File > Settings > Project > Project Interpreter > Gear Icon > Add > (Pick your Base Python Version) > Ok
    - A popup should appear to install requriements. Do that.

From here, you'll just need a few more pieces of information.

1) If you want to include non-Python files in your package, add them to the "MANIFEST.in" file with the following format(s):
    - include path/to/file/file_name.txt
    - include include/full/path/*
    - include include/only/text/files/*.txt

2) If you are including something from a file in the same package, make sure to include it as follows:
    - from . import thing_from_same_directory
    - from .. import thing_from_parent_directory
    - from .classes import thing_from_class_directory

3) If you use the "classes" directory, make sure to include all components you want access to in the __init__.py file:
    - from .file_name import thing_from_class_directory

4) Before you commit code, run the "tox.ini" file (you can do this by right clicking > Run Tox in Pycharm)
